== Moving From Scala 2 to Scala 3

After some early peeks at https://dotty.epfl.ch[the Dotty website] on a few
occasions in 2019, I started looking more closely at the
https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/overview.html[Dotty reference documentation]
after reading the release notes of the https://dotty.epfl.ch/blog/2019/12/20/21th-dotty-milestone-release.html[0.21.0-RC1 Dotty release].
That release marked an important milestone, namely, the announcement of Dotty as
feature-complete. After reading the article https://www.scala-lang.org/2019/12/18/road-to-scala-3.html[Scala 2 roadmap update: The Road to Scala 3], which was
referenced in the release notes, I had all I needed to test some ideas with Dotty's
new Union Types. You may have read the full report on this in https://www.lunatech.com/2020/02/using-dotty-union-types-with-akka-typed[part I] and
https://www.lunatech.com/2020/02/using-dotty-union-types-with-akka-typed-part-ii[part II]
of the ***Using Dotty Union types with Akka Typed*** articles. I'm pretty sure that
this approach will be adopted in some form in a future version of the Akka toolkit
as an alternative to the rather convoluted way of dealing with responses to messages
in Akka Typed (something which is necessary because of some limitations of the Scala
2 compiler).

So, with that behind me, I was wondering about what to do next... Now, I've always
been very keen on learning new stuff, but even more on sharing knowledge with
others. I've taught many technical courses and [co-]developed different courses on
Scala and Akka while at Lightbend. So, a little less than two months ago, I decided
to start working on a new course that would target existing Scala 2 developers and
that would help them with the move to Scala 3. The general idea I started from was
to take an existing Scala 2 application, select a number of key features in Dotty,
and apply these to the application in a step-by-step fashion. The end goal was to
show how these features improve and reduce the complexity in the original code.

When I floated the idea about this new course at Lunatech, I got two enthusiastic
colleagues, _Neil Benn_ and _Robin Raju_, to join me in the effort. After about 2
months, we delivered the first edition of the two-day _"Moving from Scala 2 to Scala
3"_ course to a group of colleagues.

Between the start of the project and the first delivery, the alpha version of the
course was kindly and thoroughly reviewed by members of the Scala Center (thanks SÃ©bastien and Julien!). We
received a lot of very useful feedback which resulted in a series of corresponding
updates to the course materials. Speaking of which: we have a series of 11
exercises, a course slide deck with approximately 150 slides, and a collection of
code-snippets that can be used to demonstrate various features of the Dotty language
covered in the course. The topics and Dotty features that we cover in the course  are:

* The Dotty compiler's syntax rewriting capabilities
* https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/dropped-features/package-objects.html[Top Level Definitions]
* https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/other-new-features/parameter-untupling.html[Parameter Untupling]
* https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/contextual/extension-methods.html[New Extension Methods syntax]
* Dotty Contextual Abstractions
** https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/contextual/givens.html[Given Instances]
** https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/contextual/given-imports.html[Given Imports]
** https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/contextual/using-clauses.html[Using Clauses]
** https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/contextual/using-clauses.html#summoning-instances[Summon]
* https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/enums/enums.html[Enumerations]
* https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/other-new-features/export.html[Export clauses]
* https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/new-types/intersection-types.html[Intersection Types] & https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/new-types/union-types.html[Union Types]
* https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/other-new-features/opaques.html[Opaque Type Aliases]
* https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/contextual/multiversal-equality.html[Multiversal Equality]

Very important to note is that all these materials are open-sourced! You can find
them in https://github.com/lunatech-labs/lunatech-scala-2-to-scala3-course[this
public repository] on Github. This means that you can benefit from this at no extra
cost but the effort you put into studying the course materials! _(Of course, should
you wish to have this course taught to you in-class, feel free to reach out to us
and we're happy to talk!)_.

== What's next...

So, _"What's next?"_, you may ask. Well, in fact, quite a bit... Here's list of
things that are in the works:

* We plan to keep the course current with the release candidates of Dotty. At the time of writing, Dotty is at release 0.24.0-RC1 with 0.25 around the corner.
* We will release versions of the course on a regular basis tracking Dotty's progress and our coverage of Dotty features. You can following along https://github.com/lunatech-labs/lunatech-scala-2-to-scala3-course/releases[here].
* We're looking at covering other new features in Dotty in the course. Stay tuned for that!

In a nutshell, a _"studentified"_ version of the course is an artifact generated
from the https://github.com/lunatech-labs/lunatech-scala-2-to-scala3-course/tree/exercises-master/exercises[course master repository].
This artifact is a self-contained sbt project that has special functionality built-in
to provide a friendly learning experience. A student can navigate between different
exercises, pull in relevant test code automatically, read exercise instructions via
a manual page command, save and restore the state of the code, and _"pull"_ the
solution if required.

A _"linearized"_ version of the course is a _git_ repository where every exercise in
the course has a corresponding commit in the repo. As such, it can be used to
quickly inspect the changes between subsequent exercises. This artifact also serves
another purpose: it is an essential component in a workflow to evolve the code in
exercises using _git interactive rebasing_.

The transformation to _"studentified"_  and _"linearized"_ artifacts is done by the
https://github.com/lightbend/course-management-tools[Course Management Tools]
_(CMT)_ that I started developing while at https://www.lightbend.com[Lightbend].

In case you want to learn more about _CMT_ and how it was used while building this
course: Neil, Robin and myself had a tech talk with colleagues last week about this
very topic. You can view a recording of this talk  https://youtu.be/2zmXTGG7Nkg[here].
